# Default FeatherBoard comes with a board called "default". All players have the permission
# featherboard.group.default  (by default) meaning all players should see the scoreboard unless
# the permission is negated.

# Example of the use of settings
# This section is optional
settings:
  # If you quickly want to change the
  # the label color change it here.
  # It replaces $setting_label-color$ throughout the entire config
  label-color: "&e"
  # Show or hide the health
  # This is an example of the script
  show-health: true
  # The priority of the scoreboard. The higher the number -> higher priority
  # Used when having more than one scoreboard assigned
  priority: 10

# Example of pre processing script

  title:
    # Every line has its own frames. The animation will loop through these frames on intervals
    # that you configure below.
